## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## Analyzing Build Sizes

The next.js analyzer is configured to run on `npm run build` when the environment variable ANALYZE is true.
Within your terminal `$ export ANALYZE=true` then run the build command to generate a bundle analysis.
