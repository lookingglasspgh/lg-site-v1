  DESCRIPTION: (
    <span>
      Neighborhood Fragments is an AR experiment created with drone photography
      and photogrammetry and inspired by questions around historic preservation and
      digital-aided analysis.
      <br />
      <br />
      Juxtaposed within this 3D scene are captures of spaces in East Liberty representing
      community anchors (Kelly Strayhorn Theater, Rodman Street Missionary Baptist Church)
      and signs of the exclusionary development that has reshaped the neighborhood.
